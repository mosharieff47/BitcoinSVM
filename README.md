# BitcoinSVM
This program utilizes a Support Vector Machine to classify whether to go Long or Short based on price data patterns. Additionally, the probability of the classification being correct is included in the output. This was all written in C++ but uses Python Objects to load Scikit-Learn and trains the model on live data.
